>> # This example highlights a slightly tricky issue with the Ig Cp correlations
>> # Once the Cp correlations are extended out of their range, the values can go negative or be unrealistic
>> 
>> # This causes an unusual maxima in the enthalpy as a function of T at high temperatures, which causes
>> # enthalpy searches to fail since the enthalpy is no longer a monotonic function of T.
>> 
>> # The current fix in the thermo is to essentially extrapolate outside the valid range for each component
>> # Is that the best answer aside from getting more IG Cp data at high temperatures? Not sure.
>> # Without good quality IG Cp data, the calculations at high temp are suspect
